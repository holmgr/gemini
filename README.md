## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Source code documentation for the project is available at: https://holmgr.github.io/gemini/ which is automatically built from master on every update.

### Prerequisites

This project is based on the Tauri cross-platform desktop framework which combines Rust code in the "backend" with a lightweight webbased frontend similar to Electron but with much lower overhead.

To start developing or running the project you will need the prerequisits for Tauri. See https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites.

### Running

After cloning the repository it is as simple as first installing all dependencies with

```sh
npm install
```

And then running the dev-server with

```
npm run tauri dev
```

The application should start by itself.

## Built With

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) - The Rust language
* [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) - Build an optimized, secure, and frontend-independent application for multi-platform deployment.
* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) - Next Generation Frontend Tooling
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types.

## Contributing
